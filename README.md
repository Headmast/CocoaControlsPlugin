CocoaControls.app and Xcode plugin
===================

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeahdongcn/CocoaControlsPlugin/master/screenshot.png)

##TODO
* `Refresh and load more controls` `Done`
* `Integrate Pods` `Done`
* `Add refresh button and load more button at the bottom (for those people using mouse)`

##Requirements

Xcode 5.0+ on OS X 10.9+.

##Installation

#### Build from Source

* Install pods.
* Build the Xcode project. The plug-in will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. 
* Relaunch Xcode.

To uninstall, just remove the plugin from `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins` and restart Xcode.

## How does it work?

All the commands are laid at the bottom of the menu `View`.

* Use the menu `Cocoa Controls` to open `CocoaControls.app` immediately.

##Thanks

Thanks [cocoapods-xcode-plugin](https://github.com/kattrali/cocoapods-xcode-plugin) from [Delisa Mason](https://github.com/kattrali) for the source to create/edit pod file.
